# Hospital-Efficiency-Analysis-Tableau-Case-Study
# Project Overview
In the healthcare industry, optimizing efficiency while maintaining high-quality patient care is a critical priority. Hospitals face significant challenges in managing patient length of stay (LOS), controlling operational costs, and ensuring effective resource utilization. This project, conducted for a fictional consulting firm, HealthStat, utilizes real-world hospital data to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) that impact hospital efficiency.

By leveraging Tableau, this case study explores factors contributing to variations in LOS and cost per patient, uncovering insights that can drive operational improvements. The project culminates in the development of an interactive business dashboard, providing a comprehensive, data-driven approach to hospital performance optimization.

# Project Objectives
This study aims to:

Analyze hospital efficiency metrics, focusing on LOS and cost drivers to identify patterns and trends.
Evaluate factors contributing to hospital performance differences, such as resource allocation, patient demographics, and treatment methodologies.
Develop calculated measures and KPIs in Tableau to quantify efficiency variations across hospitals.
Design an interactive and visually compelling Tableau dashboard that effectively communicates key insights to stakeholders.
Provide data-driven recommendations to improve patient care efficiency and cost management strategies.
# Methodology
Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

The dataset (patients.csv) contains real-world hospital records, including patient demographics, hospital characteristics, length of stay, and associated costs.
Data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Data Analysis & Visualization:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand distribution patterns and correlations.
Tableau visualizations were created to highlight efficiency trends across different hospitals.
Calculated fields and KPIs were developed to derive insights on cost efficiency, patient flow, and hospital performance variations.

Dashboard Development:

An interactive business dashboard (3_3_cost_dashboard_solution.twbx) was designed in Tableau.
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital efficiency metrics, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.
# Tools & Technologies Used
